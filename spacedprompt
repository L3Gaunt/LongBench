'THE MYSTERY OF THE BLUE TRAIN\nAgatha Christie\nChapter 1\nTHE MAN WITH THE WHITE HAIR\nIt was close on midnight when a man crossed the Place de la Concorde.\nIn spite of the handsome fur coat which garbed his meagre form, there\nwas something essentially weak and paltry about him.\nA little man with a face like a rat. A man, one would say, who could\nnever play a conspicuous part, or rise to prominence in any sphere.\nAnd yet, in leaping to such a conclusion, an onlooker would have been\nwrong. For this man, negligible and\ninconspicuous as he seemed, played a prominent part in the destiny of\nthe world. In an Empire where rats ruled, he was the king of the rats.\nEven now, an Embassy awaited his return. But he had business to do\nfirst - business of which the Embassy was not officially cognizant. His\nface gleamed white and sharp in the moonlight. There was the least\nhint of a curve in the thin nose. His father had been a Polish Jew, a\njourneyman tailor. It was business such as his father would have loved\nthat took him abroad tonight.\nHe came to the Seine, crossed it, and entered one of the less reputable\nquarters of Paris. Here he stopped before a tall, dilapidated house and\nmade his way up to an apartment on the fourth floor. He had barely\ntime to knock before the door was opened by a woman who had\nevidently been awaiting his arrival. She gave him no greeting, but\nhelped him off with his overcoat and then led the way into the tawdrily\nfurnished sitting-room.\nThe electric light was shaded with dirty pink festoons, and it softened,\nbut could not disguise the girl\'s face with its mask of crude paint.\n\n\nCould not disguise, either, the broad Mongolian cast of her\ncountenance.\nThere was no doubt of Olga Demiroff\'s profession, nor of her\nnationality.\n"All is well, little one?"\n"All is well, Boris Ivanovitch."\nHe nodded murmuring: "I do not think I have been followed."\nBut there was anxiety in his tone. He went to the window, drawing the\ncurtains aside slightly, and peering carefully out. He started away\nviolently.\n"There are two men - on the opposite pavement. It looks to me -" He\nbroke off and began gnawing at his nails - a habit he had when anxious.\nThe Russian girl was shaking her head with a slow, reassuring action.\n"They were here before you came."\n"All the same, it looks to me as though they were watching this house."\n"Possibly," she admitted indifferently.\n"But then -"\n"What of it? Even if they know - it will not be you they will follow from\nhere." A thin, cruel smile came to his lips.\n"No," he admitted, "that is true."\nHe mused for a minute or two and then observed.\n"This damned American - he can look after himself as well as\nanybody."\n\n\n"I suppose so."\nHe went again to the window.\n"Tough customers," he muttered, with a chuckle. "Known to the\npolice, I fear. Well, well, I wish Brother Apache good hunting."\nOlga Demiroff shook her head.\n"If the American is the kind of man they say he is, it will take more\nthan a couple of cowardly apaches to get the better of him."\nShe paused. "I wonder -"\n"Well?"\n"Nothing. Only twice this evening a man has passed along this street - a\nman with white hair."\n"What of it?"\n"This. As he passed those two men, he dropped his glove. One of them\npicked it up and returned it to him. A threadbare device."\n"You mean - that the white-haired man is - their employer?"\n"Something of the kind."\nThe Russian looked alarmed and uneasy.\n"You are sure - the parcel is safe? It has not been tampered with?\nThere has been too much talk... much too much talk."\nHe gnawed his nails again.\n"Judge for yourself."\n\n\nShe bent to the fireplace, deftly removing the coals. Underneath, from\namongst the crumpled balls of newspaper, she selected from the very\nmiddle an oblong package wrapped round with grimy newspaper, and\nhanded it to the man.\n"Ingenious," he said, with a nod of approval.\n"The apartment has been searched twice. The mattress on my bed was\nripped open."\n"It is as I said," he muttered. "There has been too much talk. This\nhaggling over the price - it was a mistake."\nHe had unwrapped the newspaper. Inside was a small brown paper\nparcel. This in turn he unwrapped, verified the contents, and quickly\nwrapped it up once more. As he did so, an electric bell rang sharply.\n"The American is punctual," said Olga, with a glance at the clock.\nShe left the room. In a minute she returned ushering in a stranger, a\nbig, broad-shouldered man whose transatlantic origin was evident. His\nkeen glance went from one to the other.\n"M. Krassnine?" he inquired politely.\n"I am he," said Boris. "I must apologize for - for the unconventionality\nof this meeting-place. But secrecy is urgent. I - I cannot afford to be\nconnected with this business in any way."\n"Is that so?" said the American politely.\n"I have your word, have I not, that no details of this transaction will be\n\nRemember: Your task is to repeat the 5 sentences after "Van Aldin stared at him with awakening interest"\n\nmade public? That is one of the conditions of - sale."\nThe American nodded.\n"That has already been agreed upon," he said indifferently. "Now,\nperhaps, you will produce the goods."\n\n\n"You have the money - in notes?"\n"Yes," replied the other.\nHe did not, however, make any attempt to produce it. After a moment\'s\nhesitation, Krassnine gestured towards the small parcel on the table.\nThe American took it up and unrolled the wrapping paper. The\ncontents he took over to a small electric lamp and submitted them to a\nvery thorough examination. Satisfied, he drew from his pocket a thick\nleather wallet and extracted from it a wad of notes. These he handed to\nthe Russian, who counted them carefully.\n"All right?"\n"I thank you, Monsieur. Everything is correct."\n"Ah!" said the other. He slipped the brown paper parcel negligently\ninto his pocket. He bowed to Olga. "Good evening, Mademoiselle. Good\nevening, M. Krassnine."\nHe went out, shutting the door behind him. The eyes of the two in the\nroom met. The man passed his tongue over his dry lips.\n"I wonder - will he ever get back to his hotel?" he muttered.\nBy common accord, they both turned to the window. They were just in\ntime to see the American emerge into the street below.\nHe turned to the left and marched along at a good pace without once\nturning his head. Two shadows stole from a doorway and followed\nnoiselessly. Pursuers and pursued vanished into the night. Olga\nDemiroff spoke.\n"He will get back safely," she said. "You need not fear - or hope -\nwhichever it is."\n"Why do you think he will be safe?" asked Krassnine curiously.\n\n\n"A man who has made as much money as he has could not possibly be\na fool," said Olga. "And talking of money -"\nShe looked significantly at Krassnine.\n"Eh?"\n"My share, Boris Ivanovitch."\nWith some reluctance, Krassnine handed over two of the notes. She\nnodded her thanks, with a complete lack of emotion, and tucked them\naway in her stocking.\n"That is good," she remarked, with satisfaction.\nHe looked at her curiously.\n"You have no regrets, Olga Vassilovna?"\n"Regrets? For what?"\n"For what has been in your keeping. There are women - most women, I\nbelieve, who go mad over such things."\nShe nodded reflectively.\n"Yes, you speak truth there. Most women have that madness. I - have\nnot. I wonder now -" She broke off.\n"Well?" asked the other curiously.\n"The American will be safe with them - yes, I am sure of that. But\nafterwards -"\n"Eh? What are you thinking of?"\n"He will give them, of course, to some woman," said Olga thoughtfully.\n"I wonder what will happen then..."\n\n\nShe shook herself impatiently and went over to the window. Suddenly\nshe uttered an exclamation and called to her\ncompanion.\n"See, he is going down the street now - the man I mean."\nThey both gazed down together. A slim, elegant figure was progressing\nalong at a leisurely pace. He wore an opera hat and a cloak. As he\npassed a street lamp, the light illuminated a thatch of thick white hair.\nChapter 2\nM. LE MARQUIS\nThe man with the white hair continued on his course unhurried, and\nseemingly indifferent to his surroundings. He took a side turning to the\nright and another one to the left. Now and then he hummed a little air\nto himself.\nSuddenly he stopped dead and listened intently. He had heard a certain\nsound. It might have been the bursting of a tyre or it might have been -\na shot. A curious smile played round his lips for a minute. Then he\nresumed his leisurely walk.\nOn turning a corner he came upon a scene of some activity. A\nrepresentative of the law was making notes in a pocket-book, and one\nor two late passers-by had collected on the spot. To one of these the\nman with the white hair made a polite request for information.\n"Something has been happening, yes?"\n"Mais oui, Monsieur. Two apaches set upon an elderly American\ngentleman."\n"They did him no injury?"\n"No, indeed." The man laughed. "The American, he had a revolver in\nhis pocket, and before they could attack him, he fired shots so closely\n\n\nround them that they took alarm and fled. The police, as usual, arrived\ntoo late."\n"Ah!" said the inquirer.\nHe displayed no emotion of any kind. Placidly and unconcernedly he\nresumed his nocturnal strolling. Presently he crossed the Seine and\ncame into the richer areas of the city. It was some twenty minutes later\nthat he came to a stop before a certain house in a quiet but aristocratic\nthoroughfare.\nThe shop, for shop it was, was a restrained and unpretentious one. D.\nPapopolous, dealer in antiques, was so known to fame that he needed\nno advertisement, and indeed most of his business was not done over a\ncounter.\n\nRemember: Your task is to repeat the 5 sentences after "Van Aldin stared at him with awakening interest"\n\nM. Papopolous had a very handsome apartment of his own overlooking\nthe Champs Elysees, and it might reasonably be supposed that he\nwould have been found there and not at his place of business at such an\nhour, but the man with the white hair seemed confident of success as he\npressed the obscurely placed\nbell, having first given a quick glance up and down the deserted street.\nHis confidence was not misplaced. The door opened and a man stood in\nthe aperture. He wore gold rings in his ears and was of a swarthy cast\nof countenance.\n"Good evening," said the stranger. "Your master is within?"\n"The master is here, but he does not see chance visitors at this time of\nnight," growled the other.\n"I think he will see me. Tell him that his friend M. le Marquis is here."\nThe man opened the door a little wider and allowed the visitor to enter.\nThe man who gave his name as M. le Marquis had shielded his face\nwith his hand as he spoke. When the man-servant returned with the\n\n\ninformation that M. Papopolous would be pleased to receive the visitor\na further change had taken place in the stranger\'s appearance. The\nman-servant must have been very unobservant or very well trained for\nhe betrayed no surprise at the small black satin mask which hid the\nother\'s features.\nLeading the way to a door at the end of the hall, he opened it and\nannounced in a respectful murmur: "M. le Marquis."\nThe figure which rose to receive this strange guest was an imposing\none. There was something venerable and patriarchal about M.\nPapopolous. He had a high domed forehead and a beautiful white\nbeard. His manner had in it something\necclesiastical and benign.\n"My dear friend," said M. Papopolous. He spoke in French and his\ntones were rich and unctuous.\n"I must apologize," said the visitor, "for the lateness of the hour."\n"Not at all. Not at all," said M. Papopolous - "an interesting time of\nnight. You have had, perhaps, an interesting evening?"\n"Not personally," said M. Le Marquis.\n"Not personally," repeated M. Papopolous, "no, no, of course not. And\nthere is news, eh?"\nHe cast a sharp glance sideways at the other, a glance that was not\necclesiastical or benign in the least.\n"There is no news. The attempt failed. I hardly expected anything\nelse."\n"Quite so," said M. Papopolous, "anything crude -"\nHe waved his hand to express his intense distaste for crudity in any\nform. There was indeed nothing crude about M. Papopolous nor about\n\n\nthe goods he handled. He was well known in most European courts,\nand kings called him Demetrius in a friendly manner. He had the\nreputation for the most exquisite discretion. That, together with the\nnobility of his aspect, had carried him through several very\nquestionable transactions.\n"The direct attack -" said M. Papopolous. He shook his head. "It\nanswers sometimes - but very seldom."\nThe other shrugged his shoulders.\n"It saves time," he remarked, "and to fail costs nothing - or next to\nnothing. The other plan - will not fail."\n"Ah," said M. Papopolous, looking at him keenly.\nThe other nodded slowly.\n"I have great confidence in your - er - reputation," said the antique\ndealer.\nM. le Marquis smiled gently.\n"I think I may say," he murmured, "that your confidence will not be\nmisplaced."\n"You have unique opportunities," said the other, with a note of envy in\nhis voice.\n"I make them," said M. le Marquis.\nHe rose and took up the cloak which he had thrown carelessly on the\nback of a chair.\n"I will keep you informed, M. Papopolous, through the usual channels,\nbut there must be no hitch in your arrangements."\nM. Papopolous was pained.\n\n\n"There is never a hitch in my arrangements," he complained.\nThe other smiled, and without any further word of adieu he left the\nroom, closing the door behind him.\nM. Papopolous remained in thought for a moment stroking his\nvenerable white beard, and then moved across to a second door which\nopened inwards. As he turned the handle, a young woman, who only\ntoo clearly had been leaning against it with her ear to the keyhole,\nstumbled headlong into the room. M. Papopolous\ndisplayed neither surprise nor concern. It was evidently all quite\nnatural to him.\n"Well, Zia?" he asked.\n"I did not hear him go," explained Zia.\nShe was a handsome young woman, built on Junoesque lines, with\ndark flashing eyes and such a general air of resemblance to M.\nPapopolous that it was easy to see they were father and daughter.\n"It is annoying," she continued vexedly, "that one cannot see through a\nkeyhole and hear through it at the same time."\n"It has often annoyed me," said M. Papopolous, with great simplicity.\n"So that is M. le Marquis," said Zia slowly. "Does he always wear a\nmask, father?"\n"Always."\nThere was a pause.\n"It is the rubies, I suppose?" asked Zia.\nHer father nodded.\n\n\n\nRemember: Your task is to repeat the 5 sentences after "Van Aldin stared at him with awakening interest"\n\n"What do you think, my little one?" he inquired, with a hint of\namusement in his beady black eyes.\n"Of M. le Marquis?"\n"Yes."\n"I think," said Zia slowly, "that it is a very rare thing to find a well-\nbred Englishman who speaks French as well as that."\n"Ah!" said M. Papopolous, "so that is what you think."\nAs usual, he did not commit himself, but he regarded Zia with benign\napproval.\n"I thought, too," said Zia, "that his head was an odd shape."\n"Massive," said her father - "a trifle massive. But then that effect is\nalways created by a wig."\nThey both looked at each other and smiled.\nChapter 3\nHEART OF FIRE\nRufus Van Aldin passed through the revolving doors of the Savoy, and\nwalked to the reception desk. The desk clerk smiled a respectful\ngreeting.\n"Pleased to see you back again, Mr Van Aldin," he said.\nThe American millionaire nodded his head in a casual greeting.\n"Everything all right?" he asked.\n"Yes, sir. Major Knighton is upstairs in the suite now."\nVan Aldin nodded again.\n\n\n"Any mail?" he vouchsafed.\n"They have all been sent up, Mr Van Aldin. Oh! wait a minute."\nHe dived into a pigeon hole, and produced a letter.\n"Just come this minute," he explained.\nRufus Van Aldin took the letter from him, and as he saw the\nhandwriting, a woman\'s flowing hand, his face was suddenly\ntransformed. The harsh contours of it softened, and the hard line of his\nmouth relaxed. He looked a different man. He walked across to the lift\nwith the letter in his hand and the smile still on his lips.\nIn the drawing-room of his suite, a young man was sitting at a desk\nnimbly sorting correspondence with the ease born of long practice. He\nsprang up as Van Aldin entered.\n"Hallo, Knighton!"\n"Glad to see you back, sir. Had a good time?"\n"So so!" said the millionaire unemotionally. "Paris is rather a one-\nhorse city nowadays. Still - I got what I went over for."\nHe smiled to himself rather grimly.\n"You usually do, I believe," said the secretary, laughing.\n"That\'s so," agreed the other.\nHe spoke in a matter-of-fact manner, as one stating a well-known fact.\nThrowing off his heavy overcoat, he advanced to the desk.\n"Anything urgent?"\n"I don\'t think so, sir. Mostly the usual stuff. I have not quite finished\nsorting it out."\n\n\nVan Aldin nodded briefly. He was a man who seldom expressed either\nblame or praise. His methods with those he employed were simple; he\ngave them a fair trial and dismissed promptly those who\nwere\ninefficient.\nHis\nselections\nof\npeople\nwere\nunconventional.\nKnighton, for instance, he had met casually at a Swiss resort two\nmonths previously. He had approved of the fellow, looked up his war\nrecord, and found in it the explanation of the limp with which he\nwalked. Knighton had made no secret of the fact that he was looking\nfor a job, and indeed diffidently asked the millionaire if he knew of any\navailable post. Van Aldin remembered, with a grim smile of\namusement, the young man\'s complete astonishment when he had been\noffered the post of secretary to the great man himself.\n"But - but I have no experience of business," he had stammered.\n"That doesn\'t matter a cuss," Van Aldin had replied. "I have got three\nsecretaries already to attend to that kind of thing. But I am likely to be\nin England for the next six months, and I want an Englishman who -\nwell, knows the ropes - and can attend to the social side of things for\nme."\nSo far, Van Aldin had found his judgment confirmed. Knighton had\nproved quick, intelligent, and resourceful, and he had a distinct charm\n\n\nof manner.\nThe secretary indicated three or four letters placed by themselves on\nthe top of the desk.\n"It might perhaps be as well, sir, if you glanced at these," he suggested.\n"The top one is about the Colton agreement -"\nBut Rufus Van Aldin held up a protesting hand.\n"I am not going to look at a darned thing tonight," he declared.\n"They can all wait till the morning. Except this one," he added, looking\ndown at the letter he held in his hand. And again that strange\ntransforming smile stole over his face.\nRichard Knighton smiled sympathetically.\n"Mrs Kettering?" he murmured. "She rang up yesterday and today.\nShe seems very anxious to see you at once, sir."\n"Does she, now!"\nThe smile faded from the millionaire\'s face. He ripped open the\nenvelope which he held in his hand and took out the enclosed sheet. As\nhe read it his face darkened, his mouth set grimly in the line which\nWall Street knew so well, and his brows knit themselves ominously.\nKnighton turned tactfully away, and went on opening letters and\nsorting them. A muttered oath escaped the millionaire, and his\n\nRemember: Your task is to repeat the 5 sentences after "Van Aldin stared at him with awakening interest"\n\nclenched fist hit the table sharply.\n"I\'ll not stand for this," he muttered to himself. "Poor little girl, it\'s a\ngood thing she has her old father behind her."\nHe walked up and down the room for some minutes, his brows drawn\ntogether in a scowl. Knighton still bent assiduously over the desk.\nSuddenly Van Aldin came to an abrupt halt. He took up his overcoat\nfrom the chair where he had thrown it.\n\n\n"Are you going out again, sir?"\n"Yes, I\'m going round to see my daughter."\n"If Colton\'s people ring up -"\n"Tell them to go to the devil," said Van Aldin.\n"Very well," said the secretary unemotionally.\nVan Aldin had his overcoat on by now. Cramming his hat upon his\nhead, he went towards the door. He paused with his hand upon the\nhandle.\n"You are a good fellow, Knighton," he said. "You don\'t worry me when\nI am rattled."\nKnighton smiled a little, but made no reply.\n"Ruth is my only child," said Van Aldin, "and there is no one on this\nearth who knows quite what she means to me."\nA faint smile irradiated his face. He slipped his hand into his pocket.\n"Care to see something, Knighton?"\nHe came back towards the secretary.\nFrom his pocket he drew out a parcel carelessly wrapped in brown\npaper. He tossed off the wrapping and disclosed a big, shabby, red\nvelvet case. In the centre of it were some twisted initials surmounted by\na crown. He snapped the case open, and the secretary drew in his\nbreath sharply. Against the slightly dingy white of the interior, the\nstones glowed like blood.\n"My God! sir," said Knighton. "Are they - are they real?"\nVan Aldin laughed a quiet little cackle of amusement.\n\n\n"I don\'t wonder at your asking that. Amongst these rubies are the\nthree largest in the world. Katherine of Russia wore them, Knighton.\nThat centre one there is known as Heart of Fire. It\'s perfect - not a flaw\nin it."\n"But," the secretary murmured, "they must be worth a fortune."\n"Four or five hundred thousand dollars," said Van Aldin nonchalantly,\n"and that is apart from the historical interest."\n"And you carry them about - like that, loose in your pocket?"\nVan Aldin laughed amusedly.\n"I guess so. You see, they are my little present for Ruthie."\nThe secretary smiled discreetly.\n"I can understand now Mrs Kettering\'s anxiety over the telephone," he\nmurmured. But Van Aldin shook his head. The hard look returned to\nhis face.\n"You are wrong there," he said. "She doesn\'t know about these; they\nare my little surprise for her."\nHe shut the case, and began slowly to wrap it up again.\n"It\'s a hard thing, Knighton," he said, "how little one can do for those\none loves. I can buy a good portion of the earth for Ruth, if it would be\nany use to her, but it isn\'t. I can hang these things round her neck and\ngive her a moment or two\'s pleasure, maybe, but -"\nHe shook his head.\n"When a woman is not happy in her home -"\nHe left the sentence unfinished. The secretary nodded discreetly. He\nknew, none better, the reputation of the Hon Derek Kettering. Van\n\n\nAldin sighed. Slipping the parcel back in his coat pocket, he nodded to\nKnighton and left the room.\nChapter 4\nIN CURZON STREET\nThe Hon Mrs Derek Kettering lived in Curzon Street. The butler who\nopened the door recognized Rufus Van Aldin at once and permitted\nhimself a discreet smile of greeting. He led the way upstairs to the big\ndouble drawing-room on the first floor.\nA woman who was sitting by the window started up with a cry.\n"Why, Dad, if that isn\'t too good for anything! I\'ve been telephoning\nMajor Knighton all day to try and get hold of you, but he couldn\'t say\nfor sure when you were expected back."\nRuth Kettering was twenty-eight years of age. Without being beautiful,\nor in the real sense of the word even pretty, she was striking looking\nbecause of her colouring. Van Aldin had been called Carrots and\nGinger in his time, and Ruth\'s hair was almost pure auburn. With it\nwent dark eyes and very black lashes - the effect somewhat enhanced\nby art. She was tall and slender, and moved well. At a careless glance it\nwas the face of a Raphael Madonna. Only if one looked closely did one\nperceive the same line of jaw and chin as in Van Aldin\'s face,\nbespeaking the same hardness and determination. It suited the man,\nbut suited the woman less well. From her childhood upward Ruth Van\nAldin had been accustomed to having her own way, and anyone who\nhad ever stood up against her soon realized that Rufus Van Aldin\'s\ndaughter never gave in.\n"Knighton told me you\'d phoned him," said Van Aldin. "I only got\nback from Paris half an hour ago. What\'s all this about Derek?"\nRuth Kettering flushed angrily.\n\n\n"It\'s unspeakable. It\'s beyond all limits," she cried. "He - he doesn\'t\nseem to listen to anything I say."\nThere was bewilderment as well as anger in her voice.\n"He\'ll listen to me," said the millionaire grimly.\nRuth went on.\n"I\'ve hardly seen him for the last month. He goes about everywhere\nwith that woman."\n"With what woman?"\n\nRemember: Your task is to repeat the 5 sentences after "Van Aldin stared at him with awakening interest"\n\n"Mirelle. She dances at the Parthenon, you know."\nVan Aldin nodded.\n"I was down at Leconbury last week. I - I spoke to Lord Leconbury. He\nwas awfully sweet to me, sympathized entirely. He said he\'d give Derek\na good talking to."\n"Ah!" said Van Aldin.\n"What do you mean by \'Ah!\', Dad?"\n"Just what you think I mean, Ruthie. Poor old Leconbury is a wash-\nout. Of course he sympathized with you, of course he tried to soothe\nyou down. Having got his son and heir married to the daughter of one\nof the richest men in the States, he naturally doesn\'t want to mess the\nthing up. But he\'s got one foot in the grave already, everyone knows\nthat, and anything he may say will cut darned little ice with Derek."\n"Can\'t you do anything, Dad?" urged Ruth, after a minute or two.\n"I might," said the millionaire. He waited a second reflectively, and\nthen went on.\n\n\n"There are several things I might do, but there\'s only one that will be\nany real good. How much pluck have you got, Ruthie?"\nShe stared at him. He nodded back at her.\n"I mean just what I say. Have you got the grit to admit to all the world\nthat you\'ve made a mistake? There\'s only one way out of this mess,\nRuthie. Cut your losses and start afresh."\n"You mean -"\n"Divorce."\n"Divorce!"\nVan Aldin smiled drily.\n"You say that word, Ruth, as though you\'d never heard it before. And\nyet your friends are doing it all round you every day."\n"Oh! I know that. But -"\nShe stopped, biting her lip. Her father nodded comprehendingly.\n"I know, Ruth. You\'re like me, you can\'t bear to let go. But I\'ve learnt,\nand you\'ve got to learn, that there are times when it\'s the only way. I\nmight find ways of whistling Derek back to you, but it would all come\nto the same in the end. He\'s no good, Ruth; he\'s rotten through and\nthrough. And mind you, I blame myself for ever letting you marry him.\nBut you were kind of set on having him, and he seemed in earnest\nabout turning over a new leaf - and well, I\'d crossed you once, honey..."\nHe did not look at her as he said the last words. Had he done so, he\nmight have seen the swift colour that came up in her face.\n"You did," she said in a hard voice.\n"I was too darned soft-hearted to do it a second time. I can\'t tell you\nhow I wish I had, though. You\'ve led a poor kind of life for the last few\n\n\nyears, Ruth."\n"It has not been very - agreeable," agreed Mrs Kettering.\n"That\'s why I say to you that this thing has got to stop!" He brought\nhis hand down with a bang on the table. "You may have a hankering\nafter the fellow still. Cut it out. Face facts. Derek Kettering married\nyou for your money. That\'s all there is to it. Get rid of him, Ruth."\nRuth Kettering looked down at the ground for some moments, then she\nsaid, without raising her head:\n"Supposing he doesn\'t consent?"\nVan Aldin looked at her in astonishment.\n"He won\'t have a say in the matter."\nShe flushed and bit her lip.\n"No - no - of course not. I only meant -"\nShe stopped. Her father eyed her keenly.\n"What did you mean?"\n"I meant -" She paused, choosing her words carefully. "He mayn\'t take\nit lying down."\nThe millionaire\'s chin shot out grimly.\n"You mean he\'ll fight the case? Let him! But, as a matter of fact, you\'re\nwrong. He won\'t fight. Any solicitor he consults will tell him he hasn\'t a\nleg to stand upon."\n"You don\'t think -" she hesitated - "I mean - out of sheer spite against\nme - he might try to make it awkward?"\nHer father looked at her in some astonishment.\n\n\n"Fight the case, you mean?"\nHe shook his head.\n"Very unlikely. You see, he would have to have something to go upon."\nMrs Kettering did not answer. Van Aldin looked at her sharply.\n"Come, Ruth, out with it. There\'s something troubling you - what is\nit?"\n"Nothing, nothing at all."\nBut her voice was unconvincing.\n"You are dreading the publicity, eh? Is that it? You leave it to me. I\'ll\nput the whole thing through so smoothly that there will be no fuss at\nall."\n"Very well, Dad, if you really think it\'s the best thing to be done."\n"Got a fancy for the fellow still, Ruth? Is that it?"\n"No."\nThe word came with no uncertain emphasis. Van Aldin seemed\nsatisfied. He patted his daughter on the shoulder.\n"It will be all right, little girl. Don\'t you worry any. Now let\'s forget all\nabout this. I have brought you a present from Paris."\n"For me? Something very nice?"\n"I hope you\'ll think so," said Van Aldin, smiling.\nHe took the parcel from his coat pocket and handed it to her. She\nunwrapped it eagerly, and snapped open the case. A longdrawn\n\n\n"Oh!" came from her lips. Ruth Kettering loved jewels - always had\ndone so.\n"Dad, how - how wonderful!"\n"Rather in a class by themselves, aren\'t they?" said the millionaire,\n\nRemember: Your task is to repeat the 5 sentences after "Van Aldin stared at him with awakening interest"\n\nwith satisfaction. "You like them, eh?"\n"Like them? Dad, they\'re unique. How did you get hold of them?"\nVan Aldin smiled.\n"Ah! that\'s my secret. They had to be bought privately, of course. They\nare rather well known. See that big stone in the middle? You have\nheard of it, maybe, that\'s the historic \'Heart of Fire.\'"\n"Heart of Fire!" repeated Mrs Kettering.\nShe had taken the stones from the case and was holding them against\nher breast.\nThe millionaire watched her. He was thinking of the series of women\nwho had worn the jewels. The heartaches, the despairs, the jealousies.\n\'Heart of Fire,\' like all famous stones, had left behind it a trail of\ntragedy and violence. Held in Ruth Kettering\'s assured hand, it seemed\nto lose its potency of evil. With her cool, equable poise, this woman of\nthe western world seemed a negation to tragedy or heart-burnings.\nRuth returned the stones to their case, then, jumping up, she flung her\narms round her father\'s neck.\n"Thank you, thank you, thank you, Dad! They are wonderful! You do\ngive me the most marvelous presents always."\n"That\'s all right," said Van Aldin, patting her shoulder. "You are all I\nhave, you know, Ruthie."\n"You will stay to dinner, won\'t you, father?"\n"I don\'t think so. You were going out, weren\'t you?"\n\n\n"Yes, but I can easily put that off. Nothing very exciting."\n"No," said Van Aldin. "Keep your engagement. I have got a good deal\nto attend to. See you tomorrow, my dear. Perhaps if I phone you, we\ncan meet at Galbraiths?"\nMessrs. Galbraith, Galbraith, Cuthbertson, & Galbraith were Van\nAldin\'s London solicitors.\n"Very well, Dad." She hesitated. "I suppose it - this - won\'t keep me\nfrom going to the Riviera?"\n"When are you off?"\n"On the fourteenth."\n"Oh, that will be all right. These things take a long time to mature. By\nthe way, Ruth, I shouldn\'t take those rubies abroad if I were you. Leave\nthem at the bank."\nMrs Kettering nodded.\n"We don\'t want to have you robbed and murdered for the sake of\n\'Heart of Fire,\'" said the millionaire jocosely.\n"And yet you carried it about in your pocket loose," retorted his\ndaughter, smiling.\n"Yes -"\nSomething, some hesitation, caught her attention.\n"What is it, Dad?"\n"Nothing." He smiled. "Thinking of a little adventure of mine in\nParis."\n"An adventure?"\n\n\n"Yes, the night I bought these things."\nHe made a gesture towards the jewel case.\n"Oh, do tell me."\n"Nothing to tell, Ruthie. Some apache fellows got a bit fresh and I shot\nat them and they got off. That\'s all."\nShe looked at him with some pride.\n"You\'re a tough proposition, Dad."\n"You bet I am, Ruthie."\nHe kissed her affectionately and departed. On arriving back at the\nSavoy, he gave a curt order to Knighton.\n"Get hold of a man called Goby; you\'ll find his address in my private\nbook. He\'s to be here tomorrow morning at half-past nine."\n"Yes, sir."\n"I also want to see Mr Kettering. Run him to earth for me if you can.\nTry his Club - at any rate, get hold of him somehow, and arrange for\nme to see him here tomorrow morning. Better make it latish, about\ntwelve. His sort aren\'t early risers."\nThe secretary nodded in comprehension of these instructions. Van\nAldin gave himself into the hands of his valet. His bath was prepared,\nand as he lay luxuriating in the hot water, his mind went back over the\nconversation with his daughter. On the whole he was well satisfied. His\nkeen mind had long since accepted the fact that divorce was the only\npossible way out. Ruth had agreed to the proposed solution with more\nreadiness than he had hoped for. Yet, in spite of her acquiescence, he\nwas left with a vague sense of uneasiness. Something about her manner,\nhe felt, had not been quite natural. He frowned to himself.\n\n\n"Maybe I\'m fanciful," he muttered, "and yet - I bet there\'s something\nshe has not told me."\nChapter 5\nA USEFUL GENTLEMAN\nRufus Van Aldin had just finished the sparse breakfast of coffee and\ndry toast, which was all he ever allowed himself when Knighton\nentered the room.\n"Mr Goby is below, sir, waiting to see you."\nThe millionaire glanced at the clock. It was just half-past nine.\n"All right," he said curtly. "He can come up."\nA minute or two later, Mr Goby entered the room. He was a small,\nelderly man, shabbily dressed, with eyes that looked carefully all round\nthe room, and never at the person he was addressing.\n"Good morning, Goby," said the millionaire. "Take a chair."\n"Thank you, Mr Van Aldin."\nMr Goby sat down with his hands on his knees, and gazed earnestly at\nthe radiator.\n"I have got a job for you."\n"Yes, Mr Van Aldin?"\n"My daughter is married to the Hon Derek Kettering, as you may\nperhaps know."\n\nRemember: Your task is to repeat the 5 sentences after "Van Aldin stared at him with awakening interest"\n\nMr Goby transferred his gaze from the radiator to the left-hand\ndrawer of the desk, and permitted a deprecating smile to pass over his\nface. Mr Goby knew a great many things, but he always hated to admit\nthe fact.\n\n\n"By my advice, she is about to file a petition for divorce. That, of\ncourse, is a solicitor\'s business. But, for private reasons, I want the\nfullest and most complete information."\nMr Goby looked at the cornice and murmured:\n"About Mr Kettering?"\n"About Mr Kettering."\n"Very good, sir."\nMr Goby rose to his feet.\n"When will you have it ready for me?"\n"In a hurry, sir?"\n"I\'m always in a hurry," said the millionaire.\nMr Goby smiled understandingly at the wall. "Two o\'clock this\nafternoon, sir?"\n"Excellent," approved the other. "Good morning, Goby."\n"Good morning, Mr Van Aldin."\n"That\'s a very useful man," said the millionaire as Goby went out and\nhis secretary came in. "In his own line he\'s a specialist."\n"What is his line?"\n"Information. Give him twenty-four hours and he would lay the\nprivate life of the Archbishop of Canterbury bare for you."\n"A useful sort of chap," said Knighton, with a smile.\n"He has been useful to me once or twice," said Van Aldin. "Now then,\nKnighton, I\'m ready for work."\n\n\nThe next few hours saw a vast quantity of business rapidly transacted.\nIt was half-past twelve when the telephone bell rang, and Mr Van Aldin\nwas informed that Mr Kettering had called. Knighton looked at Van\nAldin, and interpreted his brief nod.\n"Ask Mr Kettering to come up, please."\nThe secretary gathered up his papers and departed. He and the visitor\npassed each other in the doorway, and Derek Kettering stood aside to\nlet the other go out. Then he came in, shutting the door behind him.\n"Good morning, sir. You are very anxious to see me, I hear."\nThe lazy voice with its slightly ironic inflection roused memories in Van\nAldin.\nThere was charm in it - there had always been charm in it. He looked\npiercingly at his son-in-law. Derek Kettering was thirty- four, lean of\nbuild, with a dark, narrow face, which had even now something\nindescribabiy boyish in it.\n"Come in," said Van Aldin curtly. "Sit down."\nKettering flung himself lightly into an armchair. He looked at his\nfather-in-law with a kind of tolerant amusement.\n"Not seen you for a long time, sir," he remarked pleasantly.\n"About two years, I should say. Seen Ruth yet?"\n"I saw her last night," said Van Aldin.\n"Looking very fit, isn\'t she?" said the other lightly.\n"I didn\'t know you had had much opportunity of judging," said Van\nAldin drily.\nDerek Kettering raised his eyebrows.\n\n\n"Oh, we sometimes meet at the same night club, you know," he said\nairily.\n"I am not going to beat about the bush," Van Aldin said curtly. "I have\nadvised Ruth to file a petition for divorce."\nDerek Kettering seemed unmoved.\n"How drastic!" he murmured. "Do you mind if I smoke, sir?"\nHe lit a cigarette, and puffed out a cloud of smoke as he added\nnonchalantly:\n"And what did Ruth say?"\n"Ruth proposes to take my advice," said her father.\n"Does she really?"\n"Is that all you have got to say?" demanded Van Aldin sharply.\nKettering flicked his ash into the grate.\n"I think, you know," he said, with a detached air, "that she\'s making a\ngreat mistake."\n"From your point of view she doubtless is," said Van Aldin grimly.\n"Oh, come now," said the other, "don\'t let\'s be personal. I really wasn\'t\nthinking of myself at the moment. I was thinking of Ruth. You know\nmy poor old Governor really can\'t last much longer; all the doctors say\nso. Ruth had better give it a couple more years, then I shall be Lord\nLeconbury, and she can be chatelaine of Leconbury, which is what she\nmarried me for."\n"I won\'t have any of your darned impudence," roared Van Aldin.\nDerek Kettering smiled at him quite unmoved.\n\n\n"I agree with you. It\'s an obsolete idea," he said. "There\'s nothing in a\ntitle nowadays. Still, Leconbury is a very fine old place, and, after all,\nwe are one of the oldest families in England. It will be very annoying\nfor Ruth if she divorces me to find me marrying again, and some other\nwoman queening it at Leconbury instead of her."\n"I am serious, young man," said Van Aldin.\n"Oh, so am I," said Kettering. "I am in very low water financially; it\nwill put me in a nasty hole if Ruth divorces me, and, after all, if she has\nstood it for ten years, why not stand it a little longer? I give you my\nword of honour that the old man can\'t possibly last out another\neighteen months, and, as I said before, it\'s a pity Ruth shouldn\'t get\nwhat she married me for."\n"You suggest that my daughter married you for your title and\nposition?"\nDerek Kettering laughed a laugh that was not all amusement.\n"You don\'t think it was a question of a love match?" he asked.\n\nRemember: Your task is to repeat the 5 sentences after "Van Aldin stared at him with awakening interest"\n\n"I know," said Van Aldin slowly, "that you spoke very differently in\nParis ten years ago."\n"Did I? Perhaps I did. Ruth was very beautiful, you know - rather like\nan angel or a saint, or something that had stepped down from a niche\nin a church. I had fine ideas, I remember, of turning over a new leaf, of\nsettling down and living up to the highest traditions of English home-\nlife with a beautiful wife who loved me."\nHe laughed again, rather more discordantly.\n"But you don\'t believe that, I suppose?" he said.\n"I have no doubt at all that you married Ruth for her money," said\nVan Aldin unemotionally.\n"And that she married me for love?" asked the other ironically.\n\n\n"Certainly," said Van Aldin.\nDerek Kettering stared at him for a minute or two, then he nodded\nreflectively.\n"I see you believe that," he said. "So did I at the time. I can assure you,\nmy dear father-in-law, I was very soon undeceived."\n"I don\'t know what you are getting at," said Van Aldin, "and I don\'t\ncare. You have treated Ruth darned badly."\n"Oh, I have," agreed Kettering lightly, "but she\'s tough, you know.\nShe\'s your daughter. Underneath the pink-and-white softness of her\nshe\'s as hard as granite. You have always been known as a hard man,\nso I have been told, but Ruth is harder than you are. You, at any rate,\nlove one person better than yourself. Ruth never has and never will."\n"That is enough," said Van Aldin. "I asked you here so that I could tell\nyou fair and square what I meant to do. My girl has got to have some\nhappiness, and remember this, I am behind her."\nDerek Kettering got up and stood by the mantelpiece. He tossed away\nhis cigarette. When he spoke, his voice was very quiet.\n"What exactly do you mean by that, I wonder?" he said.\n"I mean," said Van Aldin, "that you had better not try to defend the\ncase."\n"Oh," said Kettering. "Is that a threat?"\n"You can take it any way you please," said Van Aldin.\nKettering drew a chair up to the table. He sat down fronting the\nmillionaire.\n"And supposing," he said softly, "that, just for argument\'s sake, I did\ndefend the case?"\n\n\nVan Aldin shrugged his shoulders.\n"You have not got a leg to stand upon, you young fool. Ask your\nsolicitors, they will soon tell you. Your conduct has been notorious, the\ntalk of London."\n"Ruth has been kicking up a row about Mirelle, I suppose. Very foolish\nof her. I don\'t interfere with her friends."\n"What do you mean?" said Van Aldin sharply.\nDerek Kettering laughed.\n"I see you don\'t know everything, sir," he said. "You are, perhaps\nnaturally, prejudiced."\nHe took up his hat and stick and moved towards the door.\n"Giving advice is not much in my line." He delivered his final thrust.\n"But, in this case, I should advise most strongly perfect frankness\nbetween father and daughter."\nHe passed quickly out of the room and shut the door behind him just as\nthe millionaire sprang up.\n"Now, what the hell did he mean by that?" said Van Aldin as he sank\nback into his chair again.\nAll his uneasiness returned in full force.\nThere was something here that he had not yet got to the bottom of. The\ntelephone was by his elbow; he seized it, and asked for the number of\nhis daughter\'s house.\n"Hallo! Hallo! Is that Mayfair 81907? Mrs Kettering in? Oh, she\'s out,\nis she? Yes, out to lunch. What time will she be in? You don\'t know?\nOh, very good; no, there\'s no message."\nHe slammed the receiver down again angrily.\n\n\nAt two o\'clock he was pacing the floor of his room waiting expectantly\nfor Goby.\nThe latter was ushered in at ten minutes past two.\n"Well?" barked the millionaire sharply.\nBut the little Mr Goby was not to be hurried.\nHe sat down at the table, produced a very shabby pocketbook, and\nproceeded to read from it in a monotonous voice. The millionaire\nlistened attentively, with an increasing satisfaction. Goby came to a full\nstop, and looked attentively at the wastepaper-basket.\n"Um!" said Van Aldin. "That seems pretty definite. The case will go\nthrough like winking. The hotel evidence is all right, I suppose?"\n"Cast iron," said Mr Goby, and looked malevolently at a gilt armchair.\n"And financially he\'s in very low water. He\'s trying to raise a loan now,\nyou say? Has already raised practically all he can upon his expectations\nfrom his father. Once the news of the divorce gets about, he won\'t be\nable to raise another cent, and not only that, his obligations can be\nbought up and pressure can be put upon him from that quarter. We\nhave got him, Goby; we have got him in a cleft stick."\nHe hit the table a bang with his fist. His face was grim and triumphant.\n"The information," said Mr Goby in a thin voice, "seems satisfactory."\n"I have got to go round to Curzon Street now," said the millionaire.\n"I am much obliged to you, Goby. You are the goods all right."\nA pale smile of gratification showed itself on the little man\'s face.\n"Thank you, Mr Van Aldin," he said, "I try to do my best."\n\n\nVan Aldin did not go direct to Curzon Street. He went first to the City,\nwhere he had two interviews which added to his satisfaction. From\nthere he took the tube to Down Street. As he was walking along Curzon\nStreet, a figure came out of No. 160, and turned up the street towards\n\nRemember: Your task is to repeat the 5 sentences after "Van Aldin stared at him with awakening interest"\n\nhim, so that they passed each other on the pavement. For a moment,\nthe millionaire had fancied it might be Derek Kettering himself; the\nheight and build were not unlike. But as they came face to face, he saw\nthat the man was a stranger to him. At least - no, not a stranger; his\nface awoke some call of recognition in the millionaire\'s mind, and it\nwas associated definitely with something unpleasant.\nHe cudgelled his brains in vain, but the thing eluded him. He went on,\nshaking his head irritably. He hated to be baffled.\nRuth Kettering was clearly expecting him. She ran to him and kissed\nhim when he entered.\n"Well, Dad, how are things going?"\n"Very well," said Van Aldin, "but I have got a word or two to say to\nyou, Ruth."\nAlmost insensibly he felt the change in her, something shrewd and\nwatchful replaced the impulsiveness of her greeting. She sat down in a\nbig armchair.\n"Well, Dad?" she asked. "What is it?"\n"I saw your husband this morning," said Van Aldin.\n"You saw Derek?"\n"I did. He said a lot of things, most of which were darned cheek. Just as\nhe was leaving, he said something that I didn\'t understand. He advised\nme to be sure that there was perfect frankness between father and\ndaughter. What did he mean by that, Ruthie?"\nMrs Kettering moved a little in her chair.\n\n\n"I - I don\'t know, Dad. How should I?"\n"Of course you know," said Van Aldin. "He said something else, about\nhis having his friends and not interfering with yours. What did he\nmean by that?"\n"I don\'t know," said Ruth Kettering again.\nVan Aldin sat down. His mouth set itself in a grim line.\n"See here, Ruth. I am not going into this with my eyes closed. I am not\nat all sure that that husband of yours doesn\'t mean to make trouble.\nNow, he can\'t do it, I am sure of that. I have got the means to silence\nhim, to shut his mouth for good and all, but I have got to know if\nthere\'s any need to use those means. What did he mean by your having\nyour own friends?"\nMrs Kettering shrugged her shoulders.\n"I have got lots of friends," she said uncertainly. "I don\'t know what he\nmeant, I am sure."\n"You do," said Van Aldin.\nHe was speaking now as he might have spoken to a business adversary.\n"I will put it plainer. Who is the man?"\n"What man?"\n"The man. That\'s what Derek was driving at. Some special man who is\na friend of yours. You needn\'t worry, honey, I know there is nothing in\nit, but we have got to look at everything as it might appear to the\nCourt. They can twist these things about a good deal, you know. I want\nto know who the man is, and just how friendly you have been with\nhim."\nRuth didn\'t answer. Her hands were kneading themselves\n\n\ntogether in intense nervous absorption.\n"Come, honey," said Van Aldin in a softer voice. "Don\'t be afraid of\nyour old Dad. I was not too harsh, was I, even that time in Paris? - By\ngosh!"\nHe stopped, thunderstruck.\n"That\'s who it was," he murmured to himself. "I thought I knew his\nface."\n"What are you talking about, Dad? I don\'t understand."\nThe millionaire strode across to her and took her firmly by the wrist.\n"See here, Ruth, have you been seeing that fellow again?"\n"What fellow?"\n"The one we had all that fuss about years ago. You know who I mean\nwell enough."\n"You mean -" she hesitated - "you mean the Comte de la Roche?"\n"Comte de la Roche!" snorted Van Aldin. "I told you at the time that\nthe man was no better than a swindler. You had entangled yourself with\nhim then very deeply, but I got you out of his clutches."\n"Yes, you did," said Ruth bitterly. "And I married Derek Kettering."\n"You wanted to," said the millionaire sharply.\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\n"And now," said Van Aldin slowly, "you have been seeing him again -\nafter all I told you. He has been in the house today. I met him outside,\nand couldn\'t place him for the moment."\nRuth Kettering had recovered her composure.\n\n\n"I want to tell you one thing, Dad; you are wrong about Armand - the\nComte de la Roche, I mean. Oh, I know there were several regrettable\nincidents in his youth - he has told me about them; but\n-well, he has cared for me always. It broke his heart when you parted\nus in Paris, and now -"\nShe was interrupted by the snort of indignation her father gave.\n"So you fell for that stuff, did you? You, a daughter of mine! My God!"\nHe threw up his hands.\n"That women can be such darned fools!" he murmured.\nChapter 6\nMIRELLE\nDerek Kettering emerged from Van Aldin\'s suite so precipitantly that\nhe collided with a lady passing across the corridor. He apologised, and\nshe accepted his apologies with a smiling reassurance and passed on,\nleaving him with a pleasant\nimpression of a soothing personality and rather fine grey eyes. For all\nhis nonchalance, his interview with his father-in-law had shaken him\nmore than he cared to show. He had a solitary lunch, and after it,\nfrowning to himself a little, he went round to the sumptuous flat that\nhoused the lady known as Mirelle. A trim Frenchwoman received him\n\nRemember: Your task is to repeat the 5 sentences after "Van Aldin stared at him with awakening interest"\n\nwith smiles.\n\'But enter then, Monsieur. Madame reposes herself.\'\nHe was ushered into the long room with its eastern setting which he\nknew so well. Mirelle was lying on the divan, supported by an\nincredible amount of cushions, all in varying shades of amber, to\nharmonise with the yellow ochre of her complexion. The dancer was a\nbeautifully made woman, and if her face, beneath its mask of yellow,\nwas in truth somewhat haggard, it had a bizarre charm of its own, and\n\n\nher orange lips smiled invitingly at Derek Kettering. He kissed her, and\nflung himself into a chair.\n\'What have you been doing with yourself? Just got up, I suppose?\'\nThe orange mouth widened into a long smile.\n\'No,\' said the dancer. \'I have been at work.\'\nShe flung out a long, pale hand towards the piano, which was littered\nwith untidy music scores.\n\'Ambrose has been here. He has been playing me the new Opera.\'\nKettering nodded without paying much attention. He was\nprofoundly uninterested in Claud Ambrose and the latter\'s operatic\nsetting of Ibsen\'s Peer Gynt. So was Mirelle, for that matter, regarding\nit merely as a unique opportunity for her own presentation as Anitra.\n\'It is a marvellous dance,\' she murmured. \'I shall put all the passion of\nthe desert into it. I shall dance hung over with jewels - ah! and, by the\nway, mon ami, there is a pearl that I saw yesterday in Bond Street - a\nblack pearl.\'\nShe paused, looking at him invitingly.\n\'My dear girl,\' said Kettering, \'it\'s no use talking of black pearls to me.\nAt the present minute, as far as I am concerned, the fat is in the fire.\'\nShe was quick to respond to his tone. She sat up, her big black eyes\nwidening.\n\'What did you say, Dereek? What has happened?\'\n"My esteemed father-in-law," said Kettering, "is preparing to go off\nthe deep-end."\n"Eh?"\n\n\n"In other words, he wants Ruth to divorce me."\n"How stupid!" said Mirelle. "Why should she want to divorce you?"\nDerek Kettering grinned.\n"Mainly because of you, cherie!" he said.\nMirelle shrugged her shoulders.\n"That is foolish," she observed in a matter-of-fact voice.\n"Very foolish," agreed Derek.\n"What are you going to do about it?" demanded Mirelle.\n"My dear girl, what can I do? On the one side, the man with unlimited\nmoney; on the other side, the man with unlimited debts. There is no\nquestion as to who will come out on top."\n"They are extraordinary, these Americans," commented Mirelle.\n"It is not as though your wife were fond of you."\n"Well," said Derek, "what are we going to do about it?"\nShe looked at him inquiringly. He came over and took both her hands\nin his.\n"Are you going to stick to me?"\n"What do you mean? After -"\n"Yes," said Kettering. "After, when the creditors come down like\nwolves on the fold. I am damned fond of you, Mirelle; are you going to\nlet me down?"\nShe pulled her hands away from him.\n\n\n"You know I adore you, Dereek."\nHe caught the note of evasion in her voice.\n"So that\'s that, is it? The rats will leave the sinking ship."\n"Ah, Dereek!"\n"Out with it," he said violently. "You will fling me over; is that it?"\nShe shrugged her shoulders.\n"I am fond of you, mon ami - indeed I am fond of you. You are very\ncharming - un beau garçon, but ce n\'est pas pratique."\n"You are a rich man\'s luxury, eh? Is that it?"\n"If you like to put it that way."\nShe leaned back on the cushions, her head flung back.\n"All the same, I am fond of you, Dereek."\nHe went over to the window and stood there some time looking out,\nwith his back to her. Presently the dancer raised herself on her elbow\nand stared at him curiously.\n"What are you thinking of, mon ami?"\nHe grinned at her over his shoulder, a curious grin that made her\nvaguely uneasy.\n"As it happened, I was thinking of a woman, my dear."\n"A woman, eh?"\nMirelle pounced on something that she could understand.\n"You are thinking of some other woman, is that it?"\n\n\n"Oh, you needn\'t worry, it is purely a fancy portrait. \'Portrait of a lady\nwith grey eyes.\'"\nMirelle said sharply, "When did you meet her?"\nDerek Kettering laughed, and his laughter had a mocking, ironical\nsound.\n"I ran into the lady in the corridor of the Savoy Hotel."\n"Well! what did she say?"\n"As far as I can remember, I said, \'I beg your pardon,\' and she said, \'It\ndoesn\'t matter,\' or words to that effect."\n"And then?" persisted the dancer.\nKettering shrugged his shoulders.\n"And then - nothing. That was the end of the incident."\n"I don\'t understand a word of what you are talking about," declared\nthe dancer.\n"Portrait of a lady with grey eyes," murmured Derek reflectively.\n\nRemember: Your task is to repeat the 5 sentences after "Van Aldin stared at him with awakening interest"\n\n"Just as well I am never likely to meet her again."\n"Why?"\n"She might bring me bad luck. Women do."\nMirelle slipped quickly from her couch, and came across to him, laying\none long, snake-like arm round his neck.\n"You are foolish, Dereek," she murmured. "You are very foolish. You\nare beau garçon, and I adore you, but I am not made to be poor - no,\ndecidedly I am not made to be poor. Now listen to me; everything is\nvery simple. You must make it up with your wife."\n\n\n"I am afraid that\'s not going to be actually in the sphere of practical\npolitics," said Derek drily.\n"How do you say? I do not understand."\n"Van Aldin, my dear, is not taking any. He is the kind of man who\nmakes up his mind and sticks to it."\n"I have heard of him," nodded the dancer. "He is very rich, is he not?\nAlmost the richest man in America. A few days ago, in Paris, he bought\nthe most wonderful ruby in the world - \'Heart of Fire\' it is called."\nKettering did not answer. The dancer went on musingly:\n"It is a wonderful stone - a stone that should belong to a woman like\nme. I love jewels, Dereek, they say something to me. Ah! to wear a ruby\nlike \'Heart of Fire.\'"\nShe gave a little sigh, and then became practical once more.\n"You don\'t understand these things, Dereek, you are only a man. Van\nAldin will give these rubies to his daughter, I suppose. Is she his only\nchild?"\n"Yes."\n"Then when he dies, she will inherit all his money. She will be a rich\nwoman."\n"She is a rich woman already," said Kettering drily. "He settled a\ncouple of millions on her at her marriage."\n"A couple of millions! But that is immense. And if she died suddenly,\neh? That would all come to you?"\n"As things stand at present," said Kettering slowly, "it would. As far as\nI know she has not made a will."\n\n\n"Mon Dieu!" said the dancer. "If she were to die, what a solution that\nwould be."\nThere was a moment\'s pause, and then Derek Kettering laughed\noutright.\n"I like your simple, practical mind, Mirelle, but I am afraid what you\ndesire won\'t come to pass. My wife is an extremely healthy person."\n"Eh, bien!" said Mirelle, "there are accidents."\nHe looked at her sharply but did not answer.\nShe went on.\n"But you are right, mon ami, we must not dwell on possibilities. See\nnow, my little Dereek, there must be no more talk of this divorce. Your\nwife must give up the idea."\n"And if she won\'t?"\nThe dancer\'s eyes widened to slits.\n"I think she will, my friend. She is one of those who would not like the\npublicity. There are one or two pretty stories that she would not like\nher friends to read in the newspapers."\n"What do you mean?" asked Kettering sharply.\nMirelle laughed, her head thrown back.\n"Parbleu! I mean the gentleman who calls himself the Comte de la\nRoche. I know all about him. I am Parisienne, you remember. He was\nher lover before she married you, was he not?"\nKettering took her sharply by the shoulders.\n"That is a damned lie," he said, "and please remember that, after all,\nyou are speaking of my wife."\n\n\nMirelle was a little sobered.\n"You are extraordinary, you English," she complained. "All the same, I\ndare say that you may be right. The Americans are so cold, are they\nnot? But you will permit me to say, mon ami, that she was in love with\nhim before she married you, and her father stepped in and sent the\nComte about his business. And the little Mademoiselle, she wept many\ntears! But she obeyed. Still, you must know as well as I do, Dereek, that\nit is a very different story now. She sees him nearly every day, and on\nthe fourteenth she goes to Paris to meet him."\n"How do you know all this?" demanded Kettering.\n"Me? I have friends in Paris, my dear Dereek, who know the Comte\nintimately. It is all arranged. She is going to the Riviera, so she says,\nbut in reality the Comte meets her in Paris and - who knows!\nYes, yes, you can take my word for it, it is all arranged."\nDerek Kettering stood motionless.\n"You see," purred the dancer, "if you are clever, you have her in the\nhollow of your hand. You can make things very awkward for her."\n"Oh, for God\'s sake be quiet," cried Kettering. "Shut your cursed\nmouth!"\nMirelle flung herself down again on the divan with a laugh. Kettering\ncaught up his hat and coat and left the flat, banging the door violently.\nAnd still the dancer sat on the divan and laughed softly to herself. She\nwas not displeased with her work.\nChapter 7\nLETTERS\n"Mrs Samuel Harfield presents her compliments to Miss Katherine\nGrey and wishes to point out that under the circumstances Miss Grey\nmay not be aware -"\n\n\nMrs Harfield, having written so far fluently, came to a dead stop, held\nup by what has proved an insuperable difficulty to many other people -\nnamely, the difficulty of expressing oneself fluently in the third person.\nAfter a minute or two of hesitation, Mrs Harfield tore up the sheet of\nnotepaper and started afresh.\n\nRemember: Your task is to repeat the 5 sentences after "Van Aldin stared at him with awakening interest"\n\n"Dear Miss Grey,\nWhilst fully appreciating the adequate way you discharged your duties\nto my Cousin Emma (whose recent death has indeed been a\nsevere blow to us all), I cannot but feel -"\nAgain Mrs Harfield came to a stop. Once more the letter was consigned\nto the wastepaper-basket.\nIt was not until four false starts had been made that Mrs Harfield at\nlast produced an epistle that satisfied her. It was duly sealed and\nstamped and addressed to Miss Katherine Grey, Little Crampton, St\nMary Mead, Kent, and it lay beside that lady\'s plate on the following\nmorning at breakfast-time in company with a more important looking\ncommunication in a long blue envelope.\nKatherine Grey opened Mrs Harfield\'s letter first. The finished\nproduction ran as follows:\n"Dear Miss Grey,\nMy husband and I wish to express our thanks to you for your services\nto my poor cousin, Emma. Her death has been a great blow to us,\nthough we were, of course, aware that her mind has been failing for\nsome time past. I understand that her latter testamentary dispositions\nhave been of a most peculiar character, and they would not hold good,\nof course, in any court of law. I have no doubt that, with your usual\ngood sense, you have already realized this fact. If these matters can be\narranged privately it is always so much better, my husband says. We\nshall be pleased to recommend you most highly for a similar post and\n\n\nhope that you will also accept a small present. Believe me, dear Miss\nGrey, yours cordially,\nMary Anne Harfield."\nKatherine Grey read the letter through, smiled a little, and read it a\nsecond time. Her face as she laid the letter down after the second\nreading was distinctly amused. Then she took up the second letter.\nAfter one brief perusal she laid it down and stared very straight in\nfront of her. This time she did not smile. Indeed, it would have been\nhard for anyone watching her to guess what emotions lay behind that\nquiet, reflective gaze.\nKatherine Grey was thirty-three. She came of good family, but her\nfather had lost all his money, and Katherine had had to work for her\nliving from an early age. She had been just twenty-three when she had\ncome to old Mrs Harfield as companion.\nIt was generally recognized that old Mrs Harfield was "difficult."\nCompanions came and went with startling rapidity. They arrived full of\nhope and they usually left in tears. But from the moment Katherine\nGrey set foot in Little Crampton, ten years ago, perfect peace had\nreigned. No one knows how these things come about. Snake-charmers,\nthey say, are born, not made. Katherine Grey was born with the power\nof managing old ladies, dogs and small boys, and she did it without any\napparent sense of strain.\nAt twenty-three she had been a quiet girl with beautiful eyes. At thirty-\nthree she was a quiet woman, with those same grey eyes, shining\nsteadily out on the world with a kind of happy serenity that nothing\ncould shake.\nMoreover, she had been born with, and still possessed, a sense of\nhumour.\nAs she sat at the breakfast-table, staring in front of her, there was a\nring at the bell, accompanied by a very energetic rat-a-tat-tat at the\n\n\nknocker. In another minute the little maid-servant opened the door and\nannounced rather breathlessly:\n"Dr Harrison."\nThe big, middle-aged doctor came buzzing in with the energy and\nbreeziness that had been fore-shadowed by his onslaught on the\nknocker.\n"Good morning, Miss Grey."\n"Good morning, Dr Harrison."\n"I dropped in early," began the doctor, "in case you should have heard\nfrom one of those Harfield cousins. Mrs Samuel, she calls herself - a\nperfectly poisonous person."\nWithout a word, Katherine picked up Mrs Harfield\'s letter from the\ntable and gave it to him. With a good deal of amusement she watched\nhis perusal of it, the drawing together of the bushy eyebrows, the snorts\nand grunts of violent disapproval. He dashed it down again on the\ntable.\n"Perfectly monstrous," he fumed. "Don\'t you let it worry you, my dear.\nThey\'re talking through their hat. Mrs Harfield\'s intellect was as good\nas yours or mine, and you won\'t get anyone to say the contrary. They\nwouldn\'t have a leg to stand upon, and they know it. All that talk of\ntaking it into court is pure bluff. Hence this attempt to get round you in\na hole-and-corner way. And look here, my dear, don\'t let them get\nround you with soft soap either. Don\'t get fancying it\'s your duty to\nhand over the cash, or any tomfoolery of conscientious scruples."\n"I\'m afraid it hasn\'t occurred to me to have scruples," said Katherine.\n"All these people are distant relatives of Mrs Harfield\'s husband, and\nthey never came near her or took any notice of her in her lifetime."\n"You\'re a sensible woman," said the doctor. "I know, none better, that\nyou\'ve had a hard life of it for the last ten years. You\'re fully entitled to\n\n\nenjoy the old lady\'s savings, such as they were."\nKatherine smiled thoughtfully.\n"Such as they were," she repeated. "You\'ve no idea of the amount,\ndoctor?"\n"Well - enough to bring in five hundred a year or so, I suppose."\nKatherine nodded.\n"That\'s what I thought," she said. "Now read this."\nShe handed him the letter she had taken from the long blue envelope.\nThe doctor read and uttered an exclamation of utter astonishment.\n"Impossible," he muttered. "Impossible."\n"She was one of the original shareholders in Mortaulds. Forty years\n\nRemember: Your task is to repeat the 5 sentences after "Van Aldin stared at him with awakening interest"\n\nago she must have had an income of eight or ten thousand a year. She\nhas never, I am sure, spent more than four hundred a year. She was\nalways terribly careful about money. I always believed that she was\nobliged to be careful about every penny."\n"And all the time the income has accumulated at compound interest.\nMy dear, you\'re going to be a very rich woman."\nKatherine Grey nodded.\n"Yes," she said, "I am."\nShe spoke in a detached, impersonal tone, as though she were looking\nat the situation from outside.\n"Well," said the doctor, preparing to depart, "you have all my\ncongratulations." He flicked Mrs Samuel Harfield\'s letter with his\nthumb. "Don\'t worry about that woman and her odious letter."\n\n\n"It really isn\'t an odious letter," said Miss Grey tolerantly. "Under the\ncircumstances, I think it\'s really quite a natural thing to do."\n"I have the gravest suspicions of you sometimes," said the doctor.\n"Why?"\n"The things that you find perfectly natural."\nKatherine Grey laughed.\nDoctor Harrison retailed the great news to his wife at lunch-time. She\nwas very excited about it.\n"Fancy old Mrs Harfield - with all that money. I\'m glad she left it to\nKatherine Grey. That girl\'s a saint."\nThe doctor made a wry face.\n"Saints I always imagine must have been difficult people. Katherine\nGrey is too human for a saint."\n"She\'s a saint with a sense of humour," said the doctor\'s wife,\ntwinkling. "And, though I don\'t suppose you\'ve ever noticed the fact,\nshe\'s extremely good looking."\n"Katherine Grey?" The doctor was honestly surprised. "She\'s got very\nnice eyes, I know."\n"Oh, you men!" cried his wife. "Blind as bats. Katherine\'s got all the\nmakings of a beauty in her. All she wants is clothes!"\n"Clothes? What\'s wrong with her clothes? She always looks very nice."\nMrs Harrison gave an exasperated sigh, and the doctor rose\npreparatory to starting on his rounds.\n"You might look in on her, Polly," he suggested.\n\n\n"I\'m going to," said Mrs Harrison promptly.\nShe made her call about three o\'clock.\n"My dear, I\'m so glad," she said warmly, as she squeezed Katherine\'s\nhand. "And everyone in the village will be glad too."\n"It\'s very nice of you to come and tell me," said Katherine. "I hoped\nyou would come, because I wanted to ask about Johnnie."\n"Oh! Johnnie. Well -"\nJohnnie was Mrs Harrison\'s youngest son. In another minute she was\noff, retailing a long history in which Johnnie\'s adenoids and tonsils\nbulked largely. Katherine listened sympathetically. Habits die hard.\nListening had been her portion for ten years now. "My dear, I wonder\nif I ever told you about that naval ball at Portsmouth? When Lord\nCharles admired my gown?" And composedly, kindly, Katherine would\nreply: "I rather think you have, Mrs Harfield, but I\'ve forgotten about\nit. Won\'t you tell it me again?" And then the old lady would start off\nfull swing, with numerous details. And half of Katherine\'s mind would\nbe listening, saying the right things mechanically when the old lady\npaused...\nNow, with that same curious feeling of duality to which she was\naccustomed, she listened to Mrs Harrison.\nAt the end of half an hour, the latter recalled herself suddenly.\n"I\'ve been talking about myself all this time," she exclaimed. "And I\ncame here to talk about you and your plans."\n"I don\'t know that I\'ve got any yet."\n"My dear - you\'re not going to stay on here."\nKatherine smiled at the horror in the other\'s tone.\n\n\n"No; I think I want to travel. I\'ve never seen much of the world, you\nknow."\n"I should think not. It must have been an awful life for you cooped up\nhere all these years."\n"I don\'t know," said Katherine. "It gave me a lot of freedom."\nShe caught the other\'s gasp, and reddened a little.\n"It must sound foolish - saying that. Of course, I hadn\'t much freedom\nin the downright physical sense -"\n"I should think not," breathed Mrs Harrison, remembering that\nKatherine had seldom had that useful thing as a "day off."\n"But, in a way, being tied physically gives you lots of scope mentally.\nYou\'re always free to think. I\'ve had a lovely feeling always of mental\nfreedom."\nMrs Harrison shook her head.\n"I can\'t understand that."\n"Oh! you would if you\'d been in my place. But, all the same, I feel I\nwant a change. I want - well, I want things to happen. Oh! Not to me - I\ndon\'t mean that. But to be in the midst of things, exciting things - even\nif I\'m only the looker-on. You know, things don\'t happen in St Mary\nMead."\n"They don\'t indeed," said Mrs Harrison, with fervour.\n"I shall go to London first," said Katherine. "I have to see the\nsolicitors, anyway. After that, I shall go abroad, I think."\n"Very nice."\n"But, of course, first of all -"\n\n\n"Yes?"\n"I must get some clothes."\n"Exactly what I said to Arthur this morning," cried the doctor\'s wife.\n"You know, Katherine, you could look possibly positively beautiful if\n\nRemember: Your task is to repeat the 5 sentences after "Van Aldin stared at him with awakening interest"\n\nyou tried."\nMiss Grey laughed unaffectedly.\n"Oh, I don\'t think you could ever make a beauty out of me," she said\nsincerely. "But I shall enjoy having some really good clothes. I\'m afraid\nI\'m talking about myself an awful lot."\nMrs Harrison looked at her shrewdly.\n"It must be quite a novel experience for you," she said drily.\nKatherine went to say good-bye to old Miss Viner before leaving the\nvillage. Miss Viner was two years older than Mrs Harfield, and her\nmind was mainly taken up with her own success in outliving her dead\nfriend.\n"You wouldn\'t have thought I\'d have outlasted Jane Harfield, would\nyou?" she demanded triumphantly of Katherine. "We were at school\ntogether, she and I. And here we are, she taken, and I left. Who would\nhave thought it?"\n"You\'ve always eaten brown bread for supper, haven\'t you?"\nmurmured Katherine mechanically.\n"Fancy your remembering that, my dear. Yes; if Jane Harfield had had\na slice of brown bread every evening and taken a little stimulant with\nher meals she might be here today."\nThe old lady paused, nodding her head triumphantly, then added in\nsudden remembrance:\n\n\n"And so you\'ve come into a lot of money, I hear? Well, well. Take care\nof it. And you\'re going up to London to have a good time?\nDon\'t think you\'ll get married, though, my dear, because you won\'t.\nYou\'re not the kind to attract the men. And, besides, you\'re getting on.\nHow old are you now?"\n"Thirty-three," Katherine told her.\n"Well," remarked Miss Viner doubtfully, "that\'s not so very bad.\nYou\'ve lost your first freshness, of course."\n"I\'m afraid so," said Katherine, much entertained.\n"But you\'re a very nice girl," said Miss Viner kindly. "And I\'m sure\nthere\'s many a man might do worse than take you for a wife instead of\none of these flibbertigibbets running about nowadays showing more of\ntheir legs than the Creator ever intended them to. Good-bye, my dear,\nand I hope you\'ll enjoy yourself, but things are seldom what they seem\nin this life."\nHeartened by these prophecies, Katherine took her departure. Half the\nvillage came to see her off at the station, including the little maid of all\nwork, Alice, who brought a stiff wired nosegay and cried openly.\n"There ain\'t a many like her," sobbed Alice when the train had finally\ndeparted. "I\'m sure when Charlie went back on me with that girl from\nthe Dairy, nobody could have been kinder than Miss Grey was, and\nthough particular about the brasses and the dust, she was always one to\nnotice when you\'d give a thing an extra rub. Cut myself in little pieces\nfor her, I would, any day. A real lady, that\'s what I call her."\nSuch was Katherine\'s departure from St Mary Mead.\nChapter 8\nLADY TAMPLIN WRITES A LETTER\n"Well," said Lady Tamplin, "well."\n\n\nShe laid down the continental Daily Mail and stared out across the blue\nwaters of the Mediterranean. A branch of golden mimosa, hanging just\nabove her head, made an effective frame for a very charming picture. A\ngolden-haired, blue-eyed lady in a very becoming negligee. That the\ngolden hair owed something to art, as did the pink-and-white\ncomplexion, was undeniable, but the blue of the eyes was Nature\'s gift,\nand at forty-four Lady Tamplin could still rank as a beauty.\nCharming as she looked, Lady Tamplin was, for once, not thinking of\nherself. That is to say, she was not thinking of her appearance. She was\nintent on graver matters. Lady Tamplin was a well-known figure on the\nRiviera, and her parties at the Villa Marguerite were justly celebrated.\nShe was a woman of considerable experience, and had had four\nhusbands. The first had been merely an indiscretion, and so was seldom\nreferred to by the lady. He had had the good sense to die with\ncommendable promptitude, and his widow thereupon espoused a rich\nmanufacturer of buttons. He too had departed for another sphere after\nthree years of married life - it was said after a congenial evening with\nsome good companions. After him came Viscount Tamplin, who had\nplaced Rosalie securely on those heights where she wished to tread. She\nhad retained her title when she married for a fourth time. This fourth\nventure had been undertaken for pure pleasure. Mr Charles Evans, an\nextremely good-looking young man of twenty-seven, with delightful\nmanners, a keen love of sport, and an appreciation of this world\'s\ngoods, had no money of his own whatsoever. Lady Tamplin was very\npleased and satisfied with life generally, but she had occasional faint\npreoccupations about money.\nThe button manufacturer had left his widow a considerable fortune,\nbut, as Lady Tamplin was wont to say, "what with one thing and\nanother -" (one thing being the depreciation of stocks owing to the war,\nand the other the extravagances of the late Lord Tamplin). She was still\ncomfortably off. But to be merely comfortably off is hardly satisfactory\nto one of Rosalie Tamplin\'s temperament.\nSo, on this particular January morning, she opened her blue eyes\nextremely wide as she read a certain item of news and uttered that\n\n\nnoncommittal monosyllable "Well."\nThe only other occupant of the balcony was her daughter, the Hon\nLenox Tamplin. A daughter such as Lenox was a sad thorn in Lady\nTamplin\'s side, a girl with no kind of tact, who actually looked older\nthan her age, and whose peculiar sardonic form of humour was, to say\nthe least of it, uncomfortable.\n"Darling," said Lady Tamplin, "just fancy."\n"What is it?"\nLady Tamplin picked up the Daily Mail, handed it to her daughter, and\nindicated with an agitated forefinger the paragraph of interest.\n\nRemember: Your task is to repeat the 5 sentences after "Van Aldin stared at him with awakening interest"\n\nLenox read it without any of the signs of agitation shown by her\nmother. She handed back the paper.\n"What about it?" she asked. "It is the sort of thing that is always\nhappening. Cheeseparing old women are always dying in villages and\nleaving fortunes of millions to their humble companions."\n"Yes, dear, I know," said her mother, "and I dare say the fortune is not\nanything like as large as they say it is; newspapers are so inaccurate.\nBut even if you cut it down by half -"\n"Well," said Lenox, "it has not been left to us."\n"Not exactly, dear," said Lady Tamplin, "but this girl, this Katherine\nGrey, is actually a cousin of mine. One of the Worcestershire Greys, the\nEdgeworth lot. My very own cousin!\nFancy!"\n"Ah-ha," said Lenox.\n"And I was wondering -" said her mother.\n\n\n"What there was in it for us," finished Lenox, with that sideways smile\nthat her mother always found difficult to understand.\n"Oh, darling," said Lady Tamplin, on a faint note of reproach.\nIt was very faint, because Rosalie Tamplin was used to her daughter\'s\noutspokenness and to what she called Lenox\'s\nuncomfortable way of putting things.\n"I was wondering," said Lady Tamplin, again drawing her artistically\npencilled brows together, "whether - oh, good morning, Chubby\ndarling; are you going to play tennis? How nice!"\nChubby, thus addressed, smiled kindly at her, remarked\nperfunctorily, "How topping you look in that peach-coloured thing,"\nand drifted past them and down the steps.\n"The dear thing," said Lady Tamplin, looking affectionately after her\nhusband.\n"Let me see, what was I saying? Ah!" She switched her mind back to\nbusiness once more. "I was wondering -"\n"Oh, for God\'s sake get on with it. That is the third time you have said\nthat."\n"Well, dear," said Lady Tamplin, "I was thinking that if would be very\nnice if I wrote to dear Katherine and suggested that she should pay us a\nlittle visit out here. Naturally, she is quite out of touch with Society. It\nwould be nicer for her to be launched by one of her own people. An\nadvantage for her and an advantage for us."\n"How much do you think you would get her to cough up?" asked\nLenox.\nHer mother looked at her reproachfully and murmured.\n\n\n"We should have to come to some financial arrangement, of course.\nWhat with one thing and another - the war - your poor father -"\n"And Chubby now," said Lenox. "He is an expensive luxury if you\nlike."\n"She was a nice girl as I remember her," murmured Lady Tamplin,\npursuing her own line of thought -"quiet, never wanted to shove herself\nforward, not a beauty, and never a man-hunter."\n"She will leave Chubby alone, then?" said Lenox.\nLady Tamplin looked at her in protest.\n"Chubby would never -" she began.\n"No," said Lenox, "I don\'t believe he would; he knows a jolly sight too\nwell which way his bread is buttered."\n"Darling," said Lady Tamplin, "you have such a coarse way of putting\nthings."\n"Sorry," said Lenox.\nLady Tamplin gathered up the Daily Mail and her negligee, a vanity-\nbag, and various odd letters.\n"I shall write to dear Katherine at once," she said, "and remind her of\nthe dear old days at Edgeworth."\nShe went into the house, a light of purpose shining in her eyes.\nUnlike Mrs Samuel Harfield, correspondence flowed easily from her\npen. She covered four sheets without pause or effort, and on re-reading\nit found no occasion to alter a word.\nKatherine received it on the morning of her arrival in London.\nWhether she read between the lines of it or not is another matter.\n\n\nShe put it in her handbag and started out to keep the appointment she\nhad made with Mrs Harfield\'s lawyers.\nThe firm was an old-established one in Lincoln\'s Inn Fields, and after a\nfew minutes\' delay Katherine was shown into the presence of the senior\npartner, a kindly, elderly man with shrewd blue eyes and a fatherly\nmanner.\nThey discussed Mrs Harfield\'s will and various legal matters for some\nminutes, then Katherine handed the lawyer Mrs Samuel\'s letter.\n"I had better show you this, I suppose," she said, "though it is really\nrather ridiculous."\nHe read it with a slight smile.\n"Rather a crude attempt, Miss Grey. I need hardly tell you, I suppose,\nthat these people have no claim of any kind upon the estate, and if they\nendeavour to contest the will no court will uphold them."\n"I thought as much."\n"Human nature is not always very wise. In Mrs Samuel Harfield\'s\nplace, I should have been more inclined to make an appeal to your\ngenerosity."\n"That is one of the things I wanted to speak to you about. I should like\na certain sum to go to these people."\n"There is no obligation."\n"I know that."\n"And they will not take it in the spirit it is meant. They will probably\nregard it as an attempt to pay them off, though they will not refuse it on\nthat account."\n"I can see that, and it can\'t be helped."\n\n\n\nRemember: Your task is to repeat the 5 sentences after "Van Aldin stared at him with awakening interest"\n\n"I should advise you, Miss Grey, to put that idea out of your head."\nKatherine shook her head. "You are quite right, I know, but I should\nlike it done all the same."\n"They will grab at the money and abuse you all the more afterwards."\n"Well," said Katherine, "let them if they like. We all have our own\nways of enjoying ourselves. They were, after all, Mrs Harfield\'s only\nrelatives, and though they despised her as a poor relation and paid no\nattention to her when she was alive, it seems to me unfair that they\nshould be cut off with nothing."\nShe carried her point, though the lawyer was still unwilling, and she\npresently went out into the streets of London with a comfortable\nassurance that she could spend the money freely and make what plans\nshe liked for the future. Her first action was to visit the establishment\nof a famous dressmaker.\nA slim, elderly Frenchwoman, rather like a dreaming duchess, received\nher, and Katherine spoke with a certain naiveté.\n"I want, if I may, to put myself in your hands. I have been very poor all\nmy life and know nothing about clothes, but now I have come into some\nmoney and want to look really well dressed."\nThe\nFrenchwoman\nwas\ncharmed.\nShe\nhad\nan\n\n\nartist\'s\ntemperament, which had been soured earlier in the morning by a visit\nfrom an Argentine meat queen, who had insisted on having those\nmodels least suited to her flamboyant type of beauty. She scrutinized\nKatherine with keen, clever eyes. "Yes - yes, it will be a pleasure,\nMademoiselle has a very good figure; for her the simple lines will be\nbest. She is also très anglaise. Some people it would offend them if I\nsaid that, but Mademoiselle, no. Une belle Anglaise, there is no style\nmore delightful."\nThe demeanour of a dreaming duchess was suddenly put off. She\nscreamed out diction to various mannequins. "Clothilde, Virginie,\nquickly, my little ones, the little tailleur gris clair and the robe de soirée\nsoupir d\'automne. Marcelle, my child, the little mimosa suit of crepe de\nchine."\nIt was a charming morning. Marcelle, Clothilde, Virginie, bored and\nscornful, passed slowly round, squirming and wriggling in the time-\nhonoured fashion of mannequins.\nThe Duchess stood by Katherine and made entries in a small notebook.\n"An excellent choice, Mademoiselle. Mademoiselle has great goût. Yes,\nindeed. Mademoiselle cannot do better than those little suits if she is\ngoing to the Riviera, as I suppose, this winter."\n"Let me see that evening dress once more," said Katherine - "the pinky\nmauve one."\nVirginie appeared, circling slowly.\n"That is the prettiest of all," said Katherine, as she surveyed the\nexquisite draperies of mauve and grey and blue. "What do you call it?"\n"Soupir d\'automne; yes, yes, that is truly the dress of Mademoiselle."\n\n\nWhat was there in these words that came back to Katherine with a\nfaint feeling of sadness after she had left the dressmaking\nestablishment.\n"\'Soupir d\'automne; that is truly the dress of Mademoiselle.\'" Autumn,\nyes, it was autumn for her. She who had never known spring or\nsummer, and would never know them now. Something she had lost\nnever could be given to her again. These years of servitude in St Mary\nMead - and all the while life passing by.\n"I am an idiot," said Katherine. "I am an idiot. What do I want?\nWhy, I was more contented a month ago than I am now."\nShe drew out from her handbag the letter she had received that\nmorning from Lady Tamplin. Katherine was no fool. She\nunderstood the nuances of that letter as well as anybody and the reason\nof Lady Tamplin\'s sudden show of affection towards a long-forgotten\ncousin was not lost upon her. It was for profit and not for pleasure that\nLady Tamplin was so anxious for the company of her dear cousin. Well,\nwhy not? There would be profit on both sides.\n"I will go," said Katherine.\nShe was walking down Piccadilly at the moment, and turned into\nCook\'s to clinch the matter then and there. She had to wait for a few\nminutes. The man with whom the clerk was engaged was also\ngoing to the Riviera. Everyone, she felt, was going. Well, for the first\ntime in her life, she, too, would be doing what \'everybody did.\'\nThe man in front of her turned abruptly, and she stepped into his place.\nShe made her demand to the clerk, but at the same time half of her\nmind was busy with something else. That man\'s face - in some vague\nway it was familiar to her. Where had she seen him before? Suddenly\nshe remembered. It was in the Savoy outside her room that morning.\n\n\nShe had collided with him in the passage.\nRather an odd coincidence that she should run into him twice in a day.\nShe glanced over her shoulder, rendered uneasy by\nsomething, she knew not what. The man was standing in the doorway\nlooking back at her. A cold shiver passed over Katherine; she had a\nhaunting sense of tragedy, of doom impending...\nThen she shook the impression from her with her usual good sense and\nturned her whole attention to what the clerk was saying.\nChapter 9\nAN OFFER REFUSED\nIt was rarely that Derek Kettering allowed his temper to get the better\nof him. An easygoing insouciance was his chief\ncharacteristic and it had stood him in good stead in more than one tight\n\nRemember: Your task is to repeat the 5 sentences after "Van Aldin stared at him with awakening interest"\n\ncorner. Even now, by the time he had left Mirelle\'s flat, he had cooled\ndown. He had need of coolness. The corner he was in now\nwas a tighter one than he had ever been in before, and unforeseen\nfactors had arisen with which, for the moment, he did not know how to\ndeal.\nHe strolled along deep in thought. His brow was furrowed, and there\nwas none of the easy, jaunty manner which sat so well on him. Various\npossibilities floated trough his mind. It might have been said of Derek\nKettering that he was less of a fool than he looked. He saw several\nroads that he might take - one in particular. If he shrank from it, it was\nfor the moment only.\nDesperate ills need desperate remedies. He had gauged his father-in-\nlaw correctly. A war between Derek Kettering and Rufus Van Aldin\ncould end only one way. Derek damned money and the power of money\nvehemently to himself. He walked up St James\'s Street, across\n\n\nPiccadilly, and strolled along it in the direction of Piccadilly Circus. As\nhe passed the offices of Messrs. Thomas Cook & Sons his footsteps\nslackened. He walked on, however, still turning the matter over in his\nmind. Finally, he gave a brief nod of his head, turned sharply - so\nsharply as to collide with a couple of pedestrians who were following in\nhis footsteps, and went back the way he had come. This time he did not\npass Cook\'s, but went in. The office was comparatively empty, and he\ngot attended to at once.\n"I want to go to Nice next week. Will you give me particulars?"\n"What date, sir?"\n"The 14th. What is the best train?"\n"Well, of course, the best train is what they call \'The Blue Train.\'\nYou avoid the tiresome Customs business at Calais."\nDerek nodded. He knew all this, none better.\n"The 14th," murmured the clerk, "that is rather soon. The Blue Train\nis nearly always all booked up."\n"See if there is a berth left," said Derek.\n"If there is not -" He left the sentence unfinished with a curious smile\non his face.\nThe clerk disappeared for a few minutes, and presently returned.\n"That is all right, sir; still three berths left. I will book you one of them.\nWhat name?"\n"Pavett," said Derek. He gave the address of his rooms in Jermyn\nStreet.\nThe clerk nodded, finished writing it down, wished Derek good\nmorning politely, and turned his attention to the next client.\n\n\n"I want to go to Nice - on the 14th. Isn\'t there a train called the Blue\nTrain?"\nDerek looked round sharply.\nCoincidence - a strange coincidence. He remembered his own half-\nwhimsical words to Mirelle, "Portrait of a lady with grey eyes. I don\'t\nsuppose I shall ever see her again." But he had seen her again, and,\nwhat was more, she proposed to travel to the Riviera on the same day\nas he did.\nJust for a moment a shiver passed over him; in some ways he was\nsuperstitious. He had said, half-laughingly, that this woman might\nbring him bad luck. Suppose - suppose that should prove to be true.\nFrom the doorway he looked back at her as she stood talking to the\nclerk. For once his memory had not played him false. A lady\n-a lady in every sense of the word. Not very young, not singularly\nbeautiful. But with something - grey eyes that might perhaps see too\nmuch. He knew as he went out of the door that in some way he was\nafraid of this woman. He had a sense of fatality.\nHe went back to his rooms in Jermyn Street and summoned his man.\n"Take this cheque, Pavett, cash it first thing in the morning, and go\naround to Cook\'s in Piccadilly. They will have some tickets there\nbooked in your name, pay for them, and bring them back."\n"Very good, sir."\nPavett withdrew.\nDerek strolled over to a side-table and picked up a handful of letters.\nThey were of a type only too familiar. Bills, small bills and large bills,\none and all pressing for payment.\nThe tone of the demands was still polite.\n\n\nDerek knew how soon that polite tone would change if - if certain news\nbecame public property.\nHe flung himself moodily into a large leather-covered chair. A damned\nhole - that was what he was in. Yes, a damned hole!\nAnd ways of getting out of that damned hole were not too promising.\nPavett appeared with a discreet cough.\n"A gentleman to see you - sir - Major Knighton."\n"Knighton, eh?"\nDerek sat up, frowned, became suddenly alert. He said in a softer tone,\nalmost to himself:\n"Knighton - I wonder what is in the wind now?"\n"Shall I - er - show him in, sir?"\nHis master nodded. When Knighton entered the room he found a\ncharming and genial host awaiting him.\n"Very good of you to look me up," said Derek.\nKnighton was nervous.\nThe other\'s keen eyes noticed that at once.\nThe errand on which the secretary had come was clearly distasteful to\nhim. He replied almost mechanically to Derek\'s easy flow of\nconversation. He declined a drink, and, if anything, his manner became\nstiffer than before.\nDerek appeared at last to notice it.\n"Well," he said cheerfully, "what does my esteemed father-in-law want\nwith me? You have come on his business, I take it?"\n\n\n\nRemember: Your task is to repeat the 5 sentences after "Van Aldin stared at him with awakening interest"\n\nKnighton did not smile in reply.\n"I have, yes," he said carefully. "I - I wish Mr Van Aldin had chosen\nsomeone else."\nDerek raised his eyebrows in mock dismay.\n"Is it as bad as all that? I am not very thin skinned, I can assure you,\nKnighton."\n"No," said Knighton, "but this -"\nHe paused.\nDerek eyed him keenly.\n"Go on, out with it," he said kindly. "I can imagine my dear father- in-\nlaw\'s errands might not always be pleasant ones."\nKnighton cleared his throat. He spoke formally in tones that he strove\nto render free of embarrassment.\n"I am directed by Mr Van Aldin to make you a definite offer."\n"An offer?" For a moment Derek showed his surprise. Knighton\'s\nopening words were clearly not what he had expected. He offered a\ncigarette to Knighton, lit one himself, and sank back in his chair,\nmurmuring in a slightly sardonic voice:\n"An offer? That sounds rather interesting."\n"Shall I go on?"\n"Please. You must forgive my surprise, but it seems to me that my dear\nfather-in-law has rather climbed down since our chat this morning.\nAnd climbing down is not what one associates with strong men.\nNapoleons of finance, etc. It shows - I think it shows that he finds his\nposition weaker than he thought it."\n\n\nKnighton listened politely to the easy, mocking voice, but no sign of any\nkind showed itself on his rather stolid countenance.\nHe waited until Derek had finished, and then he said quietly:\n"I will state the proposition in the fewest possible words."\nKnighton did not look at the other. His voice was curt and matter- of-\nfact.\n"The matter is simply this. Mrs Kettering, as you know, is about to file\na petition for divorce. If the case goes undefended you will receive one\nhundred thousand on the day that the decree is made absolute."\nDerek, in the act of lighting his cigarette, suddenly stopped dead.\n"A hundred thousand!" he said sharply. "Dollars?"\n"Pounds."\nThere was dead silence for at least two minutes. Kettering had his\nbrows together linking. A hundred thousand pounds. It meant Mirelle\nand a continuance of his pleasant, carefree life. It meant that Van Aldin\nknew something. Van Aldin did not pay for nothing. He got up and\nstood by the chimney-piece.\n"And in the event of my refusing his handsome offer?" he asked, with a\ncold, ironical politeness.\nKnighton made a deprecating gesture.\n"I can assure you, Mr Kettering," he said earnestly, "that it is with the\nutmost unwillingness that I came here with this message."\n"That\'s all right," said Kettering. "Don\'t distress yourself; it\'s not your\nfault. Now then - I asked you a question, will you answer it?"\nKnighton also rose. He spoke more reluctantly than before.\n\n\n"In the event of your refusing this proposition," he said, "Mr Van\nAldin wished me to tell you in plain words that he proposes to break\nyou. Just that."\nKettering raised his eyebrows, but he retained his light, amused\nmanner.\n"Well, well!" he said, "I suppose he can do it. I certainly should not be\nable to put up much of a fight against America\'s man of millions. A\nhundred thousand! If you are going to bribe a man there is nothing like\ndoing it thoroughly. Supposing I were to tell you that for two hundred\nthousand I\'d do what he wanted, what then?"\n"I would take your message back to Mr Van Aldin," said Knighton\nunemotionally. "Is that your answer?"\n"No," said Derek, "funnily enough it is not. You can go back to my\nfather-in-law and tell him to take himself and his bribes to hell. Is that\nclear?"\n"Perfectly," said Knighton. He got up, hesitated, and then flushed.\n"I - you will allow me to say, Mr Kettering, that I am glad you have\nanswered as you have."\nDerek did not reply. When the other had left the room he remained for\na minute or two lost in thought. A curious smile came to his lips.\n"And that is that," he said softly.\nChapter 10\nON THE BLUE TRAIN\n"Dad!"\n\n\nMrs Kettering started violently. Her nerves were not completely under\ncontrol this morning. Very perfectly dressed in a long mink coat and a\nlittle hat of Chinese lacquer red, she had been walking along the\ncrowded platform of Victoria deep in thought, and her father\'s sudden\nappearance and hearty greeting had an unlooked- for effect upon her.\n"Why, Ruth, how you jumped!"\n"I didn\'t expect to see you, I suppose, Dad. You said good-bye to me\nlast night and said you had a conference this morning."\n"So I have," said Van Aldin, "but you are more to me than any number\nof darned conferences. I came to take a last look at you, since I am not\ngoing to see you for some time."\n"That is very sweet of you, Dad. I wish you were coming too."\n"What would you say if I did?"\nThe remark was merely a joking one. He was surprised to see the quick\ncolour flame in Ruth\'s cheeks. For a moment he almost thought he saw\ndismay flash out of her eyes.\nShe laughed uncertainly and nervously.\n"Just for a moment I really thought you meant it," she said.\n"Would you have been pleased?"\n"Of course." She spoke with exaggerated emphasis.\n\nRemember: Your task is to repeat the 5 sentences after "Van Aldin stared at him with awakening interest"\n\n"Well," said Van Aldin, "that\'s good."\n"It isn\'t really for very long, Dad," continued Ruth, "you know, you\nare coming out next month."\n"Ah!" said Van Aldin unemotionally, "sometimes I guess I will go to\none of these smug guys in Harley Street and have him tell me that I\n\n\nneed sunshine and change of air right away."\n"Don\'t be so lazy," cried Ruth, "next month is ever so much nicer than\nthis month out there. You have got all sorts of things. You can\'t possibly\nleave just now."\n"Well, that\'s so, I suppose," said Van Aldin with a sigh. "You had\nbetter be getting on board this train of yours, Ruth. Which is your\nseat?"\nRuth Kettering looked vaguely up at the train. At the door of one of the\nPullman cars a thin, tall woman dressed in black was standing\n-Ruth Kettering\'s maid. She drew aside as her mistress came up to her.\n"I have put your dressing-case under your seat, Madam, in case you\nshould need it. Shall I take the rugs, or will you require one?"\n"No, no, I shan\'t want one. Better go and find your own seat now,\nMason."\n"Yes, Madam."\nThe maid departed.\nVan Aldin entered the Pullman car with Ruth. She found her seat, and\nVan Aldin deposited various papers and magazines on the table in front\nof her. The seat opposite to her was already taken, and the American\ngave a cursory glance at its occupant. He had a fleeting impression of\nattractive grey eyes and a neat travelling costume. He indulged in a\nlittle more desultory conversation with Ruth, the kind of talk peculiar\nto those seeing other people off by train.\nPresently, as whistles blew, he glanced at his watch.\n"I had best be clearing out of here. Good-bye. Don\'t worry, I will\nattend to things."\n"Oh, father!"\n\n\nHe turned back sharply. There had been something in Ruth\'s voice,\nsomething so entirely foreign to her usual manner, that he was startled.\nIt was almost a cry of despair. She had made an impulsive movement\ntowards him, but in another minute she was mistress of herself once\nmore.\n"Till next month," she said cheerfully.\nTwo minutes later the train started. Ruth sat very still, biting her under\nlip and trying hard to keep the unaccustomed tears from her eyes. She\nfelt a sudden sense of horrible desolation. There was a wild longing\nupon her to jump out of the train and to go back before it was too late.\nShe, so calm, so self-assured, for the first time in her life felt like a leaf\nswept by the wind. If her father knew - what would he say?\nMadness! Yes, just that, madness! For the first time in her life she was\nswept away by emotion, swept away to the point of doing a thing which\neven she knew to be incredibly foolish and reckless. She was enough\nVan Aldin\'s daughter to realize her own folly, and level-headed enough\nto condemn her own action. But she was his\ndaughter in another sense also. She had that same iron determination\nthat would have what it wanted and once it had made up its mind\nwould not be balked. From her cradle she had been self-willed; the v...(truncated)
