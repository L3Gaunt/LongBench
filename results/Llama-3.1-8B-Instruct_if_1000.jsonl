They are troubled by the demands of loyalty to one's client and by the fact that one can win approval as a good, maybe even great, lawyer even though that loyalty is engrossed by over- privileged or positively distasteful clients. How, they ask, is such loyalty compatible with that devotion to the common good character- istic of high moral principles? And whatever their views of the com- mon good, they are troubled because the willingness of lawyers to help their clients use the law to the prejudice of the weak or the innocent seems morally corrupt.

However, even state- of-the-art models still regularly produce logical mistakes. To train more reliable models, we can turn either to outcome supervision, which provides feedback for a final result, or process supervision, which provides feedback for each intermediate reasoning step. Given the importance of training reliable models, and given the high cost of human feedback, it is impor- tant to carefully compare the both methods. Recent work has already begun this comparison, but many questions still remain. We conduct our own investigation, finding that process supervision significantly outper- forms outcome supervision for training models to solve problems from the challenging MATH dataset.

It is most pronounced among hosts who have never had an African American guest, suggesting only a subset of hosts discriminate.

However, conventional VFL methods may run into data deficiency as they exploit only aligned and labeled samples (belonging to different parties), leaving often the majority of unaligned and unlabeled samples unused. The data deficiency hampers the effort of the federation.

However, despite the growing interest in mobile device control agents, the absence of a commonly adopted benchmark makes it challenging to quantify scientific progress in this area. In this work, we introduce B-MoCA: a novel benchmark designed specifically for evaluating mobile device control agents. To create a realistic benchmark, we develop B-MoCA based on the Android operating system and define 60 common daily tasks. Importantly, we incorporate a randomization feature that changes various aspects of mobile devices, including user interface layouts and language settings, to assess generalization performance.

Cryoconite holes contain diverse invertebrate communities, while other invertebrates, such as Collembola, often graze on algae and windblown dead organic material on the glacier surface. Glacier mice (ovoid unattached moss balls) occur on some glaciers worldwide. Studies of these glacier mice have concentrated on their occurrence and mode of formation. There are no reports of the invertebrate communities. But, such glacier mice may provide a suitable favourable habitat and refuge for a variety of invertebrate groups to colonise the glacier surface.

Many of these reforms were prompted by demands placed on governments for improved uses of public funds. In 2005, the Malaysian government and the Manpower Planning and Modernising Unit (MAMPU) circular 2/2005 introduced the concept of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for the public sector.

We propose THEMIS, a new scheduling framework for ML training workloads. It’s GPU allocation policy enforces that ML workloads complete in a ﬁnish-time fair manner, a new notion we introduce.

Therefore, they perform poorly on sonar images with unknown degradation parameters in real-world scenarios (i.e., blind scenario). To address these issues, we propose a dual cross- refinement transformer (DCRT) for blind SR of sonar images. DCRT first constructs a large-scale degradation space based on the sonar image imaging mechanism. More importantly, we randomly sample the task-level training information to make DCRT robust on different SR tasks, thereby enhancing the blind SR capability of the network.

Yet, precise 3D control in street view generation, cru- cial for 3D perception tasks, remains elusive. Specifically, utilizing Bird’s-Eye View (BEV) as the primary condition often leads to challenges in geometry control (e.g., height), affecting the representation of object shapes, occlusion patterns, and road surface elevations, all of which are essential to perception data synthesis, es- pecially for 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we introduce MAGICDRIVE, a novel street view generation framework, offering diverse 3D geometry controls including camera poses, road maps, and 3D bounding boxes, together with textual descriptions, achieved through tailored encoding strategies. Besides, our design incorporates a cross-view attention module, ensuring consist", "response": "The correct answer is (B) MagicDrive uses Fourier embedding for 4 corner point and passes them through an MLP for encoding in training step.

This is most obvious in states such as China where blocking is used to suppress political speech; however, in the last decade blocking has also become more common in democracies, usually as part of attempts to limit the availability of child abuse images. Numerous governments have therefore settled on blocking as their “primary solution” towards preventing such images from being distributed (Villeneuve 2010).

Our models are open access under the NVIDIA Open Model License Agreement, a permissive model license that allows distribution, modification, and use of the models and its outputs. These models perform competitively to open access models on a wide range of evaluation benchmarks, and were sized to fit on a single DGX H100 with 8 GPUs when deployed in FP8 precision.
