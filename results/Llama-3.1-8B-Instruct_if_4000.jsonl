Given an image, our method leverages a retrieved or user-provided 3D reference model to guide the generation process, thereby enhancing the generation quality, gen- eralization ability, and controllability.

Discrete and continuous-time loss functions are derived for continuous, discretised and discrete data, along with sample generation procedures.
